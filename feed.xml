Then, voices like a thousand winds upon broken waves told the stories of her four lifetimes. The babel solidified into images. Page by page a book took form in the air. Finally, Adelina fell into the earth and her enchanted necklace was released to bind the meaning of the images for ages to come. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is said that if one colors all of the pages of this book and then pulls out and wears Adelina&amp;rsquo;s necklace, one will understand meaning of all images and no longer be bound by time. (Or something like that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join us for an exploration of polymer clay jewelry and Japanese book-binding and build something magical for you or your fairy friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will make / keep:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fairy tale coloring book (13 in. x 9 5/8 in. book of 20 perforated coloring pages) bound with&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A necklace with faux agate pendant made with colored and transluscent polymer clay and German glitter glass.&lt;/li&gt;

Join us for an exploration of relief printing and build memorable cards and envelopes to showcase your personal writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will make / keep:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One mounted monogram stamp (~ 2 &amp;frac14; in. x 2 &amp;frac14; in.) with the letter(s) of your choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few mini stamps for patterning (unmounted).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A set of ten (10) personalized stationary (cards and envelopes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stamp carving tool (Speedball No.1 Lino Cutter Assortment with five cutters.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;ui padded rounded image&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://louiseandclark.com/assets/images/bee-stamps.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you&amp;rsquo;ll carve and mount your monogram stamp. Next, you&amp;rsquo;ll carve mini pattern stamps (unmounted) for the interior of your envelope. Finally, you&amp;rsquo;ll build your personalized set of stationary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the stationary: Fabriano Medioevalis Stationery is a magnificent, mouldmade paper with soft a white deckle-edged made in France at the Fabriano mill. The cards are 6 &amp;frac34; in. x 4 &amp;frac12; in. and envelopes are 4 &amp;frac34; in. × 7 in.. (Cards are 260 gsm and envelopes are 120 gsm.) The quality is superb! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend creating a single-initial monogram; the simplicity is elegant and you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to both carve the stamp and build your stationary within the workshop time. See below regarding letter choices:&lt;/p&gt;
